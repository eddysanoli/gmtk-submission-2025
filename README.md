"Shusho" the dog is trapped in a time loop. He must race around a retro track in order to finish his mission, but along the way he may find anomalies that prevent him from progressing. By crashing into them, you will reset the time loop and allow "Shusho" to continue on his mission. Finish all 3 laps in the shortest time possible to escape!

Rough prototype. Controls: WASD
